                    Online donations are constantly growing. According to the 2018 Global Trends in Giving Report , 54% of donors prefer to give online with a credit or debit card. A donation is a gift for charity, humanitarian aid, or to benefit a cause. A donation may take various forms, including money, services, or goods such as clothing, toys, food, or vehicles. A donation may satisfy medical needs such as blood or organs for transplant.
                    Charitable donations of goods or services are also called gifts in kind. Donations are given without return consideration. This lack of return consideration means that, in common law, an agreement to make a donation is an "imperfect contract void for want of consideration. Only when the donation is actually made does it acquire legal status.
